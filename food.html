    <h1>The Soul of Indian Cuisine</h1>
        <div class="foodarticle6"> 
            <div>  
     
            <p>Indian cuisine is an assortment of zealously guarded culinary skills that have descended down generations, from a host of regions and communities. Yet, each is distinct in flavor, ranging from the sharpest to the subtlest.<br>

            Despite its unparalleled dietary range there’s something mystical and intrinsic about all Indian food: the reverence and thoughtfulness with which it is prepared.<br>

            The exotic blend of herbs and spices, and the intricate preparatory methods, are all intended to let the aromas and flavours sink into the fare and your senses. Not only does the food smell or look gorgeous, it fires your appetite until you and your taste buds succumb to temptation. And the seduction is total. Efforts to resist indulgence often prove futile. But you’ll feel no remorse because such sublime experiences are a step closer to spirituality.</p>
