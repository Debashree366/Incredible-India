            People come here to revel in the memorial’s magnificence, spend a leisurely evening on the lawns, enjoy a picnic with their family, or have some ice cream being sold by the various vendors nearby. <br><br>Apart from that, the road between India Gate all the way to the Rashtrapati Bhawan, together with the lovely, fresh atmosphere of the place, make it a perfect place for an evening or morning walk. One can sit on the lush, green lawns and enjoy enlivening views of the sunset with their loved ones. With so much to do, a visit to India Gate is a must on a Golden Triangle tour.<br><br>

            <p>Ever been to a movie theatre that feels more like a royal palace? If not, you surely need to get to Raj Mandir. A movie hall that is beyond the conventional concepts of traditional cinema with more than mere popcorn and soda to delight people with, Raj Mandir in Jaipur is known for its exquisite style and elegance. With its glittering chandeliers, glamourous architecture, delightful lighting, the screen’s red velvet curtains that part majestically before the starting of the film, and overall luxurious outlook, this single screened talkie looks nothing less of an Opera House. A visit to the theatre is highly recommended to make your luxury Golden Triangle tour more enjoyable!</p>
